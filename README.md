## What is a Resume Parser ?
Resume Parsing is conversion of a free-form resume document into a structured set of information suitable for storage, reporting, and manipulation by software. Resume parsing helps recruiters to efficiently manage electronic resume documents sent electronically.

Many HR Professionals use CV and Resume Parsing tools to automate the storage, import and analysis of data and text on CVs and resumes.

The most common format of a CV or resume that recruiters receive is Word or PDF. Even though these documents are easy to read and understand to us, computer interpretation is more difficult
